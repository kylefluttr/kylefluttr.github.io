<h2>1. Your relationship with Fluttr</h2>
<p>1.1 Your use of the Fluttr website (the "Website") and any Fluttr products, channels, software, data feeds and services, including the Fluttr embeddable video player (the "Fluttr Player") provided to you on or from or through the Website by Fluttr (collectively the "Service") is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Fluttr. "Fluttr" means Fluttr LLC, whose principal place of business is at 901 Cherry Avenue, San Bruno, CA 94066, United States.</p>
<p>1.2 Your legal agreement with Fluttr is made up of (A) the terms and conditions set out in this document, (B) Fluttr's Privacy Policy (<a href="//www.Fluttr.co.uk/t/privacy">https://www.Fluttr.co.uk/t/privacy</a>) and (C) Fluttr's Community Guidelines (<a href="//www.Fluttr.co.uk/t/community_guidelines">https://www.Fluttr.co.uk/t/community_guidelines</a>) (collectively called the "Terms").</p>
<p>1.3 The Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and Fluttr in relation to your use of the Service. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully.</p>
<p>1.4 The Terms apply to all users of the Service, including users who are also contributors of Content, on the Service. "Content" includes the text, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features and other materials you may view on, access through or contribute to the Service.</p>
<h2>2. Accepting the Terms</h2>
<p>2.1 In order to use the Service, you must firstly agree to the Terms. You may not use the Service if you do not accept the Terms.</p>

<h2>3. Changes to the Terms</h2>
<p>Fluttr reserves the right to make changes the Terms from time to time, for example to address changes to the law or regulatory changes or changes to functionality offered through the Service.

The modified version of the Terms (the "Modified Terms") will be posted at <a href="//www.Fluttr.co.uk/t/terms">https://www.Fluttr.co.uk/t/terms</a> or made available within the Service (for any modified additional terms). If you do not agree to the Modified Terms you must stop using the Service. Your continued use of the Service after the date the Modified Terms are posted will constitute your acceptance of the Modified Terms.</p>
<h2>4. Fluttr accounts</h2>
<p>4.1 In order to access some features of the Website or other elements of the Service, you will have to create a Fluttr account. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. It is important that you must keep your Fluttr account password secure and confidential.</p>

<h2>5. General restrictions on use</h2>
<p>5.1 Fluttr hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service, subject to the following express conditions, and you agree that your failure to adhere to any of these conditions shall constitute a breach of these Terms on your part:</p>
<ol className="upper-alpha">
<li>you agree not to distribute any part of or parts of the Website or the Service, including but not limited to any Content, in any medium without Fluttr's prior written authorisation, unless Fluttr makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service (such as the Fluttr Player);</li>
<li>you agree not to alter or modify any part of the Website or any of the Service (including but not limited to the Fluttr Player and its related technologies);</li>
<li>you agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Website itself, the Fluttr Player, or such other means as Fluttr may explicitly designate for this purpose;</li>
<li>you agree not to (or attempt to) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with any security related features of the Service or features that (i) prevent or restrict use or copying of Content or (ii) enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content accessible via the Service;</li>
<li>you agree not to use the Service (including the Fluttr Player) for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain Fluttr's prior written approval:</li>
<ol className="lower-roman">
<li>the sale of access to the Service</li>
<li>the sale of advertising, sponsorships or promotions placed on or within the Service, or Content;</li>
<li>the sale of advertising, sponsorships or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content delivered via the Service unless other material not obtained from Fluttr appears on the same page and is of sufficient value to be the basis for such sales</li>
</ol>
<li>prohibited commercial uses shall not include (i) uploading an original video to Fluttr, (ii) maintaining an original channel on the Website in order to promote a business or artistic enterprise, (iii) showing Fluttr videos through the Fluttr Player or otherwise on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to those advertising restrictions set out in 5.1(E)(iii) above; and (iv) any use that is expressly authorised by Fluttr in writing;</li>
<li>if you use the Fluttr Player on your website may not modify, build upon or block any portion or functionality of the Fluttr Player including but not limited to links back to the Website;</li>
<li>you agree not to use or launch any automated system (including, without limitation, any robot, spider or offline reader) that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Fluttr servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a publicly available, standard (i.e. not modified) web browser;</li>
<li>you agree not to collect or harvest any personal data of any user of the Website or any Service (and agree that this shall be deemed to include Fluttr account names);</li>
<li>you agree not to use the Website or the Services (including the comments and email features in the Website) for the solicitation of business in the course of trade or in connection with a commercial enterprise;</li>
<li>you agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Website with respect to their Content; and</li>
<li>you agree not to access Content or any reason other than your personal, non-commercial use solely as intended through and permitted by the normal functionality of the Service, and solely for Streaming. "Streaming" means a contemporaneous digital transmission of the material by Fluttr via the Internet to a user operated Internet enabled device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be downloaded (either permanently or temporarily), copied, stored, or redistributed by the user.</li>
<li>You shall not copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, or otherwise exploit any Content for any other purposes without the prior written consent of Fluttr or the respective licensors of the Content.</li>

<p>5.3 Fluttr grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Fluttr reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.</p>
<p>5.4 Fluttr is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Service which Fluttr provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.</p>
<p>5.5 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Fluttr may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Service (or any features within the Service) to you or to users generally at Fluttr's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Service at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Fluttr when you stop using the Service.</p>
<p>5.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Fluttr has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Fluttr may suffer) of any such breach.</p>

<p>6.1 Fluttr operates a clear copyright policy in relation to any Content that is alleged to infringe the copyright of a third party. Details of that policy can be found here: <a href="//www.Fluttr.co.uk/t/copyright_notice">https://www.Fluttr.co.uk/t/copyright_notice</a></p>

<p>7.8 On becoming aware of any potential violation of these Terms, Fluttr reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to decide whether Content complies with the content requirements set out in these Terms and may remove such Content and/or terminate a User's access for uploading Content which is in violation of these Terms at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.</p>

<h2>14. General legal terms</h2>
<p>14.1 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Fluttr and govern your use of the Service and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Fluttr in relation to the Service.

<p>14.3 You agree that if Fluttr does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Fluttr has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Fluttr's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Fluttr.</p>
<p>14.4 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>

Other than this, no other person or company shall be a third party beneficiary of the Terms.</p>
<p>14.6 The Terms, and your relationship with Fluttr under the Terms, shall be governed by English law. You and Fluttr agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Fluttr shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or other equivalent types of urgent legal remedy) in any jurisdiction.</p>
